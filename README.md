# problemsolving
### Intro
A small experimental project.
The primary goal is for me to get familiar with the Python basics, the secondary one is to put up a site that showcases some leetcode problem solutions.

All in all the goal is to create a website, that:
- Works without hosting (github pages).
- Showcases my leetcode problem solutions + comments.

### Current key feature decisions (a subject to change):
- Use vue for client side, use JSON for storing data.
- Create a python CLI script to automate the work with files & creating JSONs.

### Draft
#### Structure

/index.html - site index

/leet.py - a script to automatise work with jsons

/assets/ - a place to store css/js needed for site functioning


/problems/ - a place to store solutions

/problems/leetcode/ - leetcode solutions

/problems/leetcode/{id}/ - a place to store solution files
